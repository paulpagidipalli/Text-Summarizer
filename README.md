##Description:

This project implements a text summarization tool using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It takes input text and extracts the most important sentences to create a concise summary. The system is designed to identify key information, helping users quickly understand lengthy content.
Overview
Text summarization is a crucial task in NLP, often used in applications like news aggregation, research paper summarization, and document analysis. This tool uses sentence tokenization and word frequency analysis to determine the most important sentences in the input text. The summarization process is performed using NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) and Python’s built-in libraries.
How It Works
Tokenization – The input text is split into individual sentences.
Word Frequency Calculation – Words are counted to determine their importance.
Sentence Scoring – Each sentence is scored based on the total frequency of words it contains.
Top Sentence Selection – The highest-scoring sentences are selected for the final summary.
The user specifies the number of sentences in the summary, making the system flexible and customizable.
Project Features
Extracts key information – Generates a summary by selecting the most relevant sentences.
Flexible summary length – Users can define the number of sentences in the output.
Lightweight and efficient – Uses Python’s built-in libraries for quick processing.
Error handling – Ensures robust execution with appropriate error messages.
Installation & Dependencies
